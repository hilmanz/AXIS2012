<em>General Manager, Customer Service</em></p>
<p><em>I was drawn to AXIS by their impactful ads promoting collaboration with other operators. I thought that surely would have had to create a major challenge for Customer Service to handle so many variations of customer comments. Upon joining, I learned that the secret was a top-down commitment to putting customers first.</em></p>
<p><em>AXIS is fun!</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>It promotes a corporate culture based on openness and camaraderie with no gap between management and staff. The fun factor at AXIS is real, driven by "a young company with a young spirit", where new ideas are welcome, at every level of the organization. So if you're up for the challenge of an environment that thrives on delivering results, AXIS is the right 'home' for you!</em></p>

<em>General Manager, IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)</em></p>
<p><em>There came a chance when I wanted to move into a more challenging job, an opportunity approached me to fill a position as an IT ERP General Manager in AXIS. I was excited to take the challenge. I am proven making the right decision, besides its homey atmosphere, I gain knowledge and experience understanding how this most competitive industry works, how creative and fast people develops and markets its products to win the market.</em></p>
<p><em>I am wondering how I would have been if I never join AXIS. I might never understand the true meaning of dynamic, creative and competitive. I won't be able to tell that there is a second home in such a huge organization.</em><br />
<em>I am glad that I join AXIS now and the next 20 years hopefully.</em></p>

<em>Senior Manager Business Process and Territory management</em></p>
<p><em>I admired AXIS' daring move to compete against its "bigger Telco brothers". During my interview, I asked about their investment and permanent employee size, as these are important benchmarks to evaluate companies. Seeing it's believing, upon joining I saw ongoing investment and recruitment that translated into continued revenue. I'm confident that AXIS will continue growing into a formidable player.</em></p>
<p><em>Based on that belief, I feel motivated to work with more passion, I'm compelled to give at least one initiative per day.</em></p>
<p><em>AXIS is very dynamic. New ideas come from all layers of the organization, providing an ongoing opportunity for personal growth. Frankly, I've already been offered two jobs, which I've declined. AXIS is the future. Are you up for the challenge?</em></p>
