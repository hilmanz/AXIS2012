<p>Who we are, how we do our business and AXIS facts.</p>
<h2><strong>How We Do The Business</strong></h2>
<p>At AXIS we believe that it is not just "what we do" that is important, but also "how we do it" . We are committed to carry out our activities in a responsible way while have fun while doing our activities. Wherever we are, we have an obligation to do business with integrity and act according to our Code of Conduct and Corporate Values.</p>
<h2><strong>Goal and Vision</strong></h2>
<p>AXIS primary goal is to create greater value for our shareholders, subscribers, employees and partners, and for society in general. We strive to be a driving force in creating, simplifying and introducing mobile communication and content solutions to the marketplace.</p>
<p>Our AXIS brand articulates this ambition and our logo is a symbol of movement and change - our continuous evolution to help our subscribers get the full benefit of mobile communications services in their daily lives.</p>
<p>We want to make it easy for customers to get what they want, when they want it. We will keep promises and deliver what we say. We will innovate to deliver fresh ideas.</p>
<h2><strong>Corporate Governance</strong></h2>
<p>AXIS considers good corporate governance to be an essential tool for achieving our vision and strategic goals, complying with our values and for maintaining good corporate culture.<br />
Our corporate governance includes openness and transparency towards the company's shareholders, the Board of Management, as well as other interested parties such as the employees, regulators, customers, vendors and suppliers, public authorities and society in general.</p>
<p>We regularly review and assess governance trends and revise our policies as appropriate. AXIS is subject to Indonesian rules and regulations.</p>
<h2><strong>Corporate Values and Code of Conduct</strong></h2>
<p>We think of our Code of Conduct as a high-level road map designed to orient all of our employees. It promotes the values we aspire to bring to our work and discusses conduct we strongly discourage or prohibit. The company's corporate policies, practices and instructions supplement these principles, providing the details each of us need in our day-to-day jobs.</p>
<p>Our corporate success depends on individual performance. We must adopt and implement the highest standards of personal behavior as embedded in our corporate values - distinctive, simple, people first and accountable - which we all strive to exhibit in our everyday activities. At its heart, the Code of Conduct tells us how to embody these behaviors and values in the workplace, particularly in how we represent our company and relate to our colleagues.</p>
